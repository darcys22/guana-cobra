Nature has started to take back the earth, it didnt take very long. Without constant care the artifacts of the old ways quickly started to fade.

We still roam around, but there are a lot less of us.

We see the monuments of those who walked before us and the elders tell us stories of their magnificence. But our people became increasingly disbelieving, their technology seems so foreign to us. 

We feel the effects of every death within the tribe. Every person lost contains a part of the past that we will never recover.

Our hub for research into the past dwindles in strength. We are too small and the knowledge to recover and pass on is too great. We soon will fall into chaos.

We found a chest recently, a trove of books left behind from those who walked before us. It seems they knew something would happen so they made contingency plans.

The books give us leverage to rebuild humanities knowledge. We were back to square one, but now we can play catch up.

This is the story of the books we found...
