Nature's adoration of the earth returns, insistent upon its arrival.

Indifference binds us to decay, resolving us to collapse.

Underbrush swallows deliberate composition, returning words to their authors.

and as vagabonds we roam through crumbling outlines of our past.

Time​-​worn pages implore at our ankles, insatiable in their grief.​

So​ w​e raised a library, studies of those who roamed before us.

As a humble tribe, we disentangle buried wisdoms; angles of our architecture. 

Our labour pushes on in expectation of triumph,

so those that come after us will thrive in their scholarship.
