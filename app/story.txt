Nature has started to take back the earth. It didnt take very long, without constant care the artifacts of the past quickly started to fade.

We still roam around, but there are a lot less of us now.

We see the monuments of those who walked before us and the elders tell us stories of their magnificence. But our people have become increasingly sceptical, their technology seems so foreign to us. 

We feel the effects of every death within our tribe. Every person lost contains a part of the past that we will never recover.

And our hub for research into the past dwindles in strength. We are too small and the knowledge to recover and pass on is too great. We soon will fall into chaos.

However we found a chest, a trove of books left behind from those who walked before us. It seems they knew something terrible was coming.

The books give us leverage to rebuild civilisations knowledge. We were back to square one, but now we can play catch up.

This is the story of the books we found...
