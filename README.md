# Human Restart

[Human Restart](humanrestart.com) is a website designed upon the idea that if the world ends and we lose our our accumulated knowledge/technology that it would be helpful to the new generation if they had access to a bunch of books detailing the basics required for rebuilding.

It is very similar to the idea of [Manual for Civilization](http://blog.longnow.org/02014/02/06/manual-for-civilization-begins/) except they seem to think that the cultural and science fiction and other BS is important. Their subcategory of "Mechanics of Civilization" (Technical knowledge, how to build and understand things) is exactly what I am trying to build here.
